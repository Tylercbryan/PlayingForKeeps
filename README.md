This project was started out for a Java 244 final class project with the object of "creating a scene with a change". 
I quickly got absorbed into the project and decided to turn it into a full functioning game. 
It plays as a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game - best of 3. There are win-streak watches the player can win to add replayability. 
First they appear on their arm, then collecting crumpled on the floor if the streak continues.
Sound effects of cheering/clapping play when the user wins, crowd gasping noises play during a tie, and boo sounds play if they lose.
Life counters for each player are in the upper left and right hand side of the screen.
After a players life total is depleted, a pop up scene either congratulating the winner or denouncing the loser appears.
The game is then reset either with win streak watches now enabled or reset back to a clean state.
